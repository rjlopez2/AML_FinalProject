# COLORIZING SWITZERLAND: APPLYING DEEP LEARNING ON HISTORICAL AERIAL IMAGES

Final Project for the CAS in Advanced Machine Learning (UniBern 2023-2024)

## About

Image colorization techniques aim to transform a grayscale image by assigning colors, so it becomes visually similar to our perceived reality. This task is challenging since a number of features need to be taken into account: global color richness balance, visual harmony, the conformity to object-level semantics, etc. while minimizing the visual artifacts such as color leakage or incomplete colorization. Current advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have provided a huge contribution to automate this task. Historical aerial images is one of the many expertise domains that can profit from deep-learning base colorization applications. In this project we aim to use an existing model based on U-Net architecture and retrain it with historical aerial images from Switzerland.
